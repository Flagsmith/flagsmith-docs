# Authentication Methods

## SAML

The Flagsmith platform can be configured for a given organisation to use SAML authentication. To configure SAML login
for your organisation please get in touch with us directly to help set it up.

Note that users authenticated via SAML can only belong to one organisation, the one that the SAML configuration is tied
to.

To set up SAML authentication, we will provide you with a unique name for your SAML organisation that you must then
enter when prompted by the 'Single Sign on' dialog. We will also provide you with our Service Provider metadata and
expect your IdP metadata in return.

## LDAP

LDAP Authentication is available in our [Enterprise Edition](../enterprise-edition.md). Please contact us if this is of
interest. We also support sync-ing of LDAP groups into [Flagsmith RBAC groups](permissions.md#groups).

## AD FS

Active Directory Federation Services Authentication is available in our [Enterprise Edition](../enterprise-edition.md).

## Okta

Okta Integration is available in our [Enterprise Edition](../enterprise-edition.md).
